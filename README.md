A node-based non-destructive image editor created for my A Level NEA Project.
It written with C# and WPF, and uses ImageSharp for all of the low-level image manipulation, and some of the image effects.

- Supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, and many other common file formats
- Default nodes for many types of effects and filters, as well as noise types
- Has a public API for creating your own nodes
- Automatic UI generation for custom nodes
